# Unix shell in C (MacOs)
An educational project based on the curriculum of [ucode.world](https://ucode.world/en/). 
It is written in C for MacOs.

## This shell implements:
1. execution of external commands (bin files), 
2. execution of builtins,
3. meta-circular interpreter,
4. interpretation of complex grammar of input line including command separator ( ; ), logic operators ( && || ), pipeline ( | ), command substitution, redirections,
5. expansions of tilda (~),
6. variables ( $name, ${name}),
7. escape working accordingly in no quote, quote, double quote expressions,
8. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D,
9. command history,
10. backspace key while inputting line.

### 1. Execution external commands (bin files)
Bin files are executed in a separate process.
    _e.g._
    `ls`
    `ls -la`
    `/bin/ls -l`

### 2. Builtins implemented in the shell:
1. Echo
_e.g._ `echo "CBL World"`
    `echo CBL World`
    `echo 'CBL World'`
    `echo -n "\a"`
2. Exit
3. cd
4. pwd
5. env
6. set
7. unset
8. export
9. fg
10. path
11. yes
12. true
13. false
14. jobs
15. which

### 3. Meta-circular interpreter
Parsing and execution of the input line is done by implementation of [meta-circular interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator) described in the book _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.

### 4. Shell Grammar

#### 4.1 Grammar
Details of grammar are [here](/docs/grammar.md)

#### 4.2 Operator precedence
1. `;`
2. `||`  `&&`
3. `|`
4. `=`
5. Expansions _(see below)_ 
   5.1. ` "..." `  ` '...'  `  
   5.2. `$...` `$(...)`  
   5.3. `` `...` `` ` ${...}`  
   5.4. `~`  
6. Redirections  
   6.1. `>`  
   6.2. `>>`  
   6.3. `<`  

#### 4.3 Order of expansion performance
The following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in five steps:

1. Alias Expansion (_not implemented_)
3. Parameter Expansion (only $name and ${name})
4. Command Substitution
7. These  are performed in left-to-right fashion. On each argument, any of the five steps that are needed are performed one after the other. 
_Hence, for example, all the parts of parameter expansion are completed before command substitution is started.
After these expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters `\` `â€™` and `"` are removed._
8. Filename Expansion
